# Politics-Safe Wording Guide

Use language that reduces defensiveness and preserves relationships.

## Do
- “To unblock…”
- “To align on…”
- “Given the deadline/constraints…”
- “Here are two options with tradeoffs…”
- “What would you need to feel comfortable approving?”

## Don’t
- “This is obvious…”
- “You should have…”
- “This is wrong…”
- “Why didn’t you…”
- “We need you to…”

## Handling disagreement
- Prefer live conversation for sensitive disagreement
- Frame as constraints and shared goals
- Offer choices and ask for preference

## Exec-visible writing
- Short, factual, decision-oriented
- Risks stated with mitigations
- Avoid blame; focus on next actions
