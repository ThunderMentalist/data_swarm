# Decision Rights Guidance (Large Org)

Decision rights prevent political rework and unblock progress.

## Typical decision types
- Methodology approval (is the approach acceptable?)
- Data access approval (can we use this data, who grants access?)
- Delivery approval (is the output ready to share?)
- Comms approval (what can be said to which audiences?)
- Priority/sequence decisions (what ships first?)

## Minimal RACI-like clarity
For each decision, capture:
- decision: what is being decided
- owner_role: who has final say (role token)
- contributors: who provides input
- informed: who must be kept in the loop
- deadline: when it must be decided

## Escalation principles
- Escalate only when a decision blocks milestones
- Prefer “warm intro” escalation via sponsor role
- Avoid escalation in writing if political sensitivity is high

## Anti-patterns
- “Everyone approves”
- “No one owns it”
- “Approval after delivery”
